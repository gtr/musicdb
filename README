PROJECT PART 1
Gerardo Torres (gtc250)
=================================


Compile:
$ go build

Run:
$ ./DistSys


Testing:
1. Create: There is an "Add New Album" link in the homepage "/" which takes the
   user to a form in which to add a new album.
2. Read: The homepage displays all the albums.
3. Update: Below each album "Aritst - Title (Year)" header, there is an "Edit 
   Album Info" button which takes the user to a "Edit Album Info" page for a 
   particular album. At the bottom of this page we can change the values of the
   metadata of the album. Whichever fields are left empty will not be modified
4. Delete: In the same "Edit Album Info" page, the user has the option to 
   delete the album (under "Back to Library")
